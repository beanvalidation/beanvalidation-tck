  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter explains the purpose of a TCK and identifies the
  foundation elements of the Bean Validation TCK.</para>

  <section id="primer">
    <title>TCK Primer</title>

    <para>A TCK, or Technology Compatibility Kit, is one of the three required
    pieces for any JSR (the other two being the specification document and the
    reference implementation). The TCK is a set of tools and tests to verify
    that an implementation of the technology conforms to the specification.
    The tests are the primary component, but the tools serve an equally
    critical role of providing a framework and/or set of SPIs for executing
    the tests.</para>

    <para>The tests in the TCK are derived from assertions in the written
    specification document. The assertions are itemized in an XML document
    (<filename>tck-audit.xml</filename>), where they each get assigned a
    unique identifier, and materialize as a suite of automated tests that
    collectively validate whether an implementation complies with the
    aforementioned assertions, and in turn the specification. For a particular
    implementation to be certified, all of the required tests must pass
    (meaning the provided test suite must be run unmodified).</para>

    <para>A TCK is entirely implementation agnostic. It should validate
    assertions by consulting the specification's public API.</para>

    <title>Compatibility Testing</title>

    <para>The goal of any specification is to eliminate portability problems
    so long as the program which uses the implementation also conforms to the
    rules laid out in the specification.</para>

    <para>Executing the TCK is a form of compatibility testing. It's important
    to understand that compatibility testing is distinctly different from
    product testing. The TCK is not concerned with robustness, performance or
    ease of use, and therefore cannot vouch for how well an implementation
    meets these criteria. What a TCK can do is to ensure the exactness of an
    implementation as it relates to the specification.</para>

    <para>Compatibility testing of any feature relies on both a complete
    specification and a complete reference implementation. The reference
    implementation demonstrates how each test can be passed and provides
    additional context to the implementor during development for the
    corresponding assertion.</para>

      <title>Why Compatibility Is Important</title>

      <para>Java platform compatibility is important to different groups
      involved with Java technologies for different reasons:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Compatibility testing is the means by which the JCP ensures
          that the Java platform does not become fragmented as it is ported to
          different operating systems and hardware.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Compatibility testing benefits developers working in the Java
          programming language, enabling them to write applications once and
          deploy them across heterogeneous computing environments without
          porting.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Compatibility testing enables application users to obtain
          applications from disparate sources and deploy them with
          confidence.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Conformance testing benefits Java platform implementors by
          ensuring the same extent of reliability for all Java platform
          ports.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The Bean Validation specification goes to great lengths to ensure
      that programs written for Java EE are compatible and the TCK is rigorous
      about enforcing the rules the specification lays down.</para>

    <title>About the Bean Validation TCK</title>

    <para>The Bean Validation TCK is designed as a portable, configurable and
    automated test suite for verifying the compatibility of an implementation
    of &jsrVersion;. The test suite is built atop TestNG and provides a series
    of extensions that allow runtime packaging and deployment of JEE artifacts
    for in-container testing (Arquillian).</para>

    <para>Each test class in the suite acts as a deployable unit. The
    deployable units, or artifacts, are defined in a declarative way using
    annotations.</para>

    <para>The declarative approach allows many of the tests to be executed in
    a standalone implementation of Bean Validation, accounting for a boost in
    developer productivity. However, an implementation is only valid if all
    tests pass using the in-container execution mode. The standalone mode is
    merely a developer convenience.<note>

      <title>TCK Components</title>

      <para>The Bean Validation TCK includes the following components:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">The test suite</emphasis>, which is a
          collection of TestNG tests, the TestNG test suite descriptor and
          supplemental resources that configure Bean Validation and other
          software components.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">The TCK audit</emphasis>
          (<filename>tck-audit.xml</filename>) is used to list out the
          assertions identified in the Bean Validation specification. It
          matches the assertions to test cases in the test suite by unique
          identifier and produces a coverage report.</para>

          <para>The audit document is provided along with the TCK. Each
          assertion is defined with a reference to a chapter, section and
          paragraph from the specification document, making it easy for the
          implementor to locate the language in the specification document
          that supports the feature being tested.</para>
